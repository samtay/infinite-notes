        <h2 id="don-gately">Don Gately</h2>

<p>188 cm. (6’ 2”)
128 kg. (282 lb.)
(pp. 469)</p>

<p><strong>NOT</strong> left-handed (pp. 884)</p>

<p>Thief and drug addict, among other things.</p>

<p>Murdered (though not on purpose?) Guillaume DuPlessis. (Though Gately’s murder
charge gets taken over by Unspecified Services… pp. 463)</p>

<p>RE: Gately’s climax – is he beaten by FLQ? (see fn. 47)</p>

<p>Gately routinely drives Pat Montesian’s priceless black 1964 Ford Aventura,
despite not really having a license…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…for Gately the vehicle’s so terrifically tight and sleek it’s like being
strapped into a missle and launched at the site of a domestic errand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(pp. 461)</p>

<h3>(Boston) AA</h3>

<p>Some lengthy discussion (couched in/around Gately’s own experience of same) of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AA</li>
  <li>Boston AA</li>
  <li><a href="/infinite-notes/places/Ennet_House">Ennet House</a> and AA</li>
  <li>Gately and AA</li>
  <li>and c.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>…when he kneels at other times and prays or meditates or tries to achieve a
Big-Picture spiritual understanding of a God as he can understand Him, he
feels Nothing – not nothing, but <em>Nothing</em>, an edgeless blankness that
somehow feels worse than the sort of unconsidered atheism he Came In with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(pp. 443)</p>

<p>Gately’s main addiction is actually with oral narcotics (and Demerol in
particular), but decides to go the AA route instead of NA. (<em>Ed. note:</em> go back
and find the citation for this that contains the reason why.)</p>

<h3>Pre-Ennet House</h3>

<ul>
  <li>a girlfriend: Pamela Hoffman-Jeep (pp. 465)
    <ul>
      <li>(same Pamela as Lenz’s tattoo???)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Childhood and Family</h3>

<ul>
  <li>for a while he and his mother lived in a beach house, but they were only able
to afford the rent because it had a huge gaping hole in the roof that the
owner had simply covered with plastic (pp. 800)</li>
  <li>nicknamed “Bim” or “Bimmy”
    <ul>
      <li>his mother called him that
        <ul>
          <li>because she heard the neighborhood kids calling him that</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>he didn’t have the heart to tell her
        <ul>
          <li>it stood for <strong>Big Indestructible Moron</strong> (pp. 448)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>“Sir Osis of Thuliver” (pp. 449)</li>
  <li>First gets high (smokes a ‘desBois’) at age 9 (pp. 903)
    <ul>
      <li>and then (incidentally) watches footage of the Rodney King beatings</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Hospitalized at St. Elizabeth's</h3>

<p><em>unsure of the day when he regains consciousness…</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>briefly shares a room with Otis P. Lord</li>
  <li><a href="/infinite-notes/characters/Tiny_Ewell">Ewell</a> visits him and confides</li>
  <li>Pat M. visits him, assures him that everything will be OK, that they at Ennet
House take care of their own (implying that she is running interference for
him w/r/t/ the Finest etc.)</li>
  <li><a href="/infinite-notes/characters/Calvin_Thrust">Calvin Thrust</a> comes and gives him an update
    <ul>
      <li>this update includes everything that happens <em>after</em> Gately got shot and
lost consciousness – so we (as readers) do get that part of the story, but
we get it as told by Thrust</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>and there’s Gately, shot and toxemic and refusing pain medication, absolutely
miserable and all he can think about (while Thrust is talking) is: 
<em>Who is cooking the dinner at the house?</em></li>
  <li><a href="/infinite-notes/characters/Geoffrey_Day">Geoffrey Day</a> visits Gately and confides</li>
  <li>Gately is visited by <a href="/infinite-notes/characters/Himself">Himself’s</a> <del>ghost</del>
<em>wraith</em> (pp. 829)
    <ul>
      <li><strong>figurants</strong> (pp. 835)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Gately dreams a dream-like and embellished (and but highly personal) version
of <a href="/infinite-notes/misc/The_Entertainment"><em>Infinite Jest</em></a></li>
  <li>Gately dreams/hallucinates a visit from Ferocious Francis that gets
interrupted by a Pakistani MD that keeps describing Gately’s pain, and how the
pain is going to get worse, and then keeps offering him (Gately) various
powerful narcotics for the pain</li>
  <li>McDade and Diehl visit, but aren’t there to confide, and brought a ‘promoted’
Get Well Soon card (unsigned)</li>
</ul>
