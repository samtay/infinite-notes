<p>The patriarch of the Incandenza family.</p>

<ul>
  <li>communication problems of all kinds, apparently
    <ul>
      <li>persistent hallucination that <a href="/infinite-notes/characters/Hal">Hal</a> does not speak
        <ul>
          <li>Himself’s ghost admits to <a href="/infinite-notes/characters/Don_Gately">Gately</a> that Hal was
most like him (Himself) and had become fearful that Hal was becoming a
figurant</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>tells <a href="/infinite-notes/characters/Joelle">Joelle</a> that he cannot speak to his “undamaged”
sons w/o the presence and mediation of <a href="/infinite-notes/characters/Avril">Avril</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>pp. 31 - implication that he has “an entertainment cartridge” implanted in his skull
    <ul>
      <li>Hal + John (‘N.R.’’) Wayne + <a href="/infinite-notes/characters/Don_Gately">Gately</a> dig up his
head? for that? (what is it?)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>indicated that he did some important work toward <a href="/infinite-notes/misc/annular_fusion">“cold annular fusion”</a>
    <ul>
      <li>not explicit BUT : easy to interpret from those part of the narrative that
Himself would have patents – and thus: that explains why the family is so
well-off</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>often rendered impotent with this obsessive idea that the world had a finite
number of erections (i.e., only so many boners for the whole world) and he did
not want any wasted on himself</li>
</ul>

<h3>on Himself's Father</h3>

<ul>
  <li>a (failed) actor
    <ul>
      <li>and on that note: <em>anti</em>-method acting; very anti-Brando</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>an (arguably) failed tennis pro</li>
  <li>planned to “build a tennis pro” out of young James</li>
</ul>

<h3>on Himself's Death</h3>

<ul>
  <li>in the Year of the Trial Size Dove Bar
    <ul>
      <li>at age 54</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>buried at Québec’s L’Islet County</li>
  <li><a href="/infinite-notes/characters/Clipperton">Clipperton</a> suicide footage (allegedly) buried with him
    <ul>
      <li>see pp. 408, fn. 160</li>
