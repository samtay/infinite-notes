<p>A character indirect to the text; not part of any of the narrative’s action but:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mentioned numerous times</li>
  <li>Part of <a href="/infinite-notes/places/ETA">ETA</a> legend</li>
  <li>Allegedly his suicide footage is buried with <a href="/infinite-notes/characters/Himself">Himself</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Story goes:</p>

<p>He was an average-at-best tennis player, and but he was “independent” and
otherwise unheard of. Then he started playing matches with a Glock pistol
pressed to his own temple. He beat opponents this way, but was not really
recognized in the rankings (despite the trophies). Then Reconfiguration happened
and the new ONANTA administration <em>actually ranked</em> him. He freaked out, thumbed
a ride to ETA, and had a little <em>tête-à-tête</em> with Himself (albeit with <a href="/infinite-notes/characters/Mario">Mario</a>
looking on, as the two had a rapport). And but so then he blew his brains out.
There at ETA. In front of Himself and Mario.</p>
