<blockquote>
  <p>“morning is the soul’s night”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The oldest Incandenza boy.</p>

<p>Punter for the AZ Cardinals, #71.</p>

<p>Gave up tennis at approx. 17, when Hal was 9, and Mario was 11.</p>

<p>(There is a whole big long discourse on O. leaving tennis, and going to B.U.
presumably to play tennis, and but then to play football, and <a href="/infinite-notes/characters/CT">CT</a>
taking over the H.M. duties at <a href="/infinite-notes/places/ETA">ETA</a>, and all the tension that was
bound up in all of <em>that</em>.)</p>

<p><strong>Whereupon</strong> Orin meets <a href="/infinite-notes/characters/Joelle">PGOAT</a> at BU during like week 3 of
class (approximately) and is instantly smitten and “defects” from tennis to
college football.</p>

<p><strong>Whereupon</strong> Orin has a meteoric rise in success at college ball, as a punter;
and but so then it gets ruined through a rather ravishing injury.</p>

<h3>Seduction Strategies</h3>

<p>“12 and 16” (pp. 244)</p>

<p>Orin is obsessed with bedding young mothers. (pp. 245)</p>

<h3>Orin and [The Entertainment](/infinite-notes/misc/The_Entertainment)</h3>

<p>The A.F.R. believe… (pp. 723)</p>

<ul>
  <li>that Orin has (or has knowledge of) a master copy of <em>Infinite Jest</em>
    <ul>
      <li><em>i.e.</em>, <a href="/infinite-notes/misc/The_Entertainment">The Entertainment</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>that M. DuPlessis had received <em>his</em> copy of The Enterainment from Orin
    <ul>
      <li>(any other text to support this?)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>which begs the question: how did Orin get involved w/ M. DuPlessis?
    <ul>
      <li>and what was his motivation for leaking it to him?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>and which also suggests: that M. DuPlessis’ copy of the The Entertainment
leaked to “outside” during <a href="/infinite-notes/characters/Don_Gately">Gately’s</a> botched robbery</li>
</ul>

<p>AND/BUT: does this perhaps suggest that Orin has more to do with The
Entertainment than appears? Could he be the one mailing them around to people?</p>

<h3>(Pen?)ultimate Fate</h3>
